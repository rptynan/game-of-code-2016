		<h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>When attempting to run regularly for the first time it is difficult to stay motivated. Being accountable to someone else can greatly increase the chance that you stick with the habit. However, finding a suitable partner is difficult. RunningMate aims to solve this problem.</p>

		<h2>What is RunningMate?</h2>
        <p>RunningMate will be an app designed to help you find your ideal running partner. It aims to pair runners of a similar skill together based on their location and help them to organise runs. RunningMate will provide a platform to motivate new runners to keep running frequently through accountability. Experienced runners will be provided with the competition of a partner of similiar standard to push them to beat their personal best.</p>

		<h2>How RunningMate will work for the user</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>When a user logs in for the first time, they create an account. </br>
        This involves adding a name, and an accurate representation of their skill e.g. furthest run, time for a mile..
        </li>
        <li>Once the skill level is known, the app generates potential partners from nearby users.</li>
<li>The user can then access a page showing runners they have been matched with and have the option to choose to run with them.</li>
<li>Once two runners have matched, they will be able to organise runs together - possibly through a messaging service within the app.</li>
        </ol>
